                    Students must uphold strict discipline and decorum at all times within
                    classrooms, the college office, laboratories, the library, and the
                    entire campus. This is essential not only for their own growth but
                    also to preserve the institutionâ€™s esteemed reputation in the
                    community. They are expected to conduct themselves with utmost dignity
                    and respect, ensuring complete silence while walking down the stairs,
                    passing through corridors, and moving inside classrooms during off
                    periods. Any deviation from these principles will not be tolerated.
